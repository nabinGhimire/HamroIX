You can join the IX via ZeroTier by using the following commands:

curl -s https://install.zerotier.com | bash
zerotier-cli join af415e486ff6dafc
zerotier-cli set af415e486ff6dafc allowGlobal=true

And you are in! Now you need to inform any of the managers at https://t.me/HamroIX with your ASN and your Zerotier ID to get the session ready for you.
It may take a few hours for us to approve and get the session read for you.

Routeserver Details:
RS IPv4: 104.167.214.155
RS IPv6: 2a0e:b107:f22::155
ASN: 141703

There is a really good benefit of using Zerotier is that you are directly connected to peers as well.
So instead of a normal tunnel where it will be you -> server -> peer, it is directly from you to the peer, 
which reduces latency greatly and is perfect for transit.
