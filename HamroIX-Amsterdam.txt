Welcome To Hamro Internet eXchange Amsterdam or simply HamroIX-Amsterdam

You can join the IX via ZeroTier by using the following commands:

curl -s https://install.zerotier.com | bash
zerotier-cli join 0cccb752f728ea03
zerotier-cli set 0cccb752f728ea03 allowGlobal=true

And you are in! Now you need to inform any of the managers at https://t.me/HamroIX with your ASN and your Zerotier ID to get the session ready for you.
It may take a few hours for us to approve and get the session read for you.

Routeserver Details:
RS IPv4: 104.167.214.133
RS IPv6: 2a0e:b107:f21::1
ASN: 141703

There is a really good benefit of using Zerotier is that you are directly connected to peers as well.
So instead of a normal tunnel where it will be you -> server -> peer, it is directly from you to the peer, 
which reduces latency greatly and is perfect for transit.
