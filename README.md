# HamroIX
Welcome To Hamro Internet eXchange or simply HamroIX. We are now at multiple locations and
you have multiple options to connect to HamroIX. You can connect using physical wires or tunnels. 
We currently support ZeroTier for virtual connection. 

Please read the configuration document for different location. 
And after joining the ZT network you need to inform any of the managers at https://t.me/HamroIX 
with your ASN and your Zerotier ID to get the session ready for you.
It may take a few hours for us to approve and get the session read for you.


There is a really good benefit of using Zerotier is that you are directly connected to peers as well.
So instead of a normal tunnel where it will be you -> server -> peer, it is directly from you to the peer, 
which reduces latency greatly and is perfect for transit.
